/*
Package csrf provides a "Cross-site Request Forgery" protection middleware.

In a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack, an attacker tricks the user
or the browser into making an HTTP request to the target site from a malicious
site. The request includes the user's credentials and causes the server to
carry out some harmful action, thinking that the user intended it.
