/*
Package sse provides a "Server-Send Events" server/client implementation.

Traditionally, a web page has to send a request to the server to receive new
data; that is, the page requests data from the server. With server-sent events,
it's possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time, by
pushing messages to the web page.
