# Security Policy

Please report to us any security issues you find.

All security bugs in this repository should be reported by email to [info@bryk.io](mailto:info@bryk.io?subject=[GitHub]%20Security%20Report). This mail is delivered to a small security team. Your email will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and you'll receive a more detailed response to your email within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement. These updates will be sent at least every five days. In reality, this is more likely to be every 24-48 hours.

## Disclosure Process

This project uses the following disclosure process:

1. Once the security report is received it is assigned a primary handler. This person coordinates the fix and release process.

2. The issue is confirmed and a list of affected software is determined.

3. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.

4. If it is determined, in consultation with the submitter, that a CVE-ID is required, the primary handler will obtain one.

5. Fixes are prepared for, at least, the two most recent major releases and the head/master revision.

This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required with maintainers of other projects. Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible, however it's important that we follow the process described above to ensure that disclosures are handled consistently.
